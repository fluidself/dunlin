# Core Concepts

## Bidirectional links

DECK uses bidirectional links to help you organize your notes into a knowledge graph. You can link a note to other notes, and each note displays the notes that link to it (its "backlinks"). When you create bidirectional links, you are making two notes aware of each other and start to build connections between ideas in your DECK.

## Graph visualization

When you compile notes and link them together, they form a graph of interconnected ideas. DECK's graph visualization is a bird's eye view of your knowledge base and can help you identify connections and patterns in your graph.

## Sharing a DECK

You can join forces with a friend or community by sharing your workspace with them. To set up the access conditions, click on "Share" in the dropdown menu from the top of the sidebar. Among other options, you can grant access to an individual wallet, members of a certain DAO, or holders of a specific NFT. To accept an invitation to another DECK, click on "Join" in the dropdown menu from the top of the sidebar and enter the unique ID of the DECK you want to join.

## Note editing permissions

By default, a DECK workspace allows any of its members to edit all notes freely. The workspace owner can configure the workspace settings to only allow a note's original author to edit it.
