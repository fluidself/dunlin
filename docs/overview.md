# About DECK

DECK is an open-source notebook and knowledge graph that helps individuals, DAOs, and other communities capture, organize, make sense of, and share complex information. All notes are encrypted and can only by decrypted by the intended audience.

Individuals can use DECK to take notes, journal and compile their ideas, thoughts, and notes in an interconnected context.

DAOs and other communities can carry out collaborative research or manage projects and create knowledge bases, FAQs, and guides. Access to workspaces can be granted using tokens, NFTs, and blockchain identity as keys.
